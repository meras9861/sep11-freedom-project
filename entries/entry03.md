I decided to do a bit more tinkering with <b>A-Frame</b> throughout the last couple of months to be even more comfortable with all the formatting and designs this tool has to offer. Not only did I use the actual A-Frame website, but I also wanted to watch quick and simple tutorials on how to use this tool on <b>Youtube</b>. Some videos I watched involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1RdCVuu98">building enviornments</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFPMxqod2I">examples code</a>. These videos were very helpful with introducing the wide variety of strategies I could use to help build the location I want for my Freedom Project. Since I am doing a project revolving around an outer space setting.
