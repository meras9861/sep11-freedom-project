### Sources
I decided to do a bit more tinkering with <b>A-Frame</b> throughout the last couple of months to be even more comfortable with all the formatting and designs this tool has to offer. Not only did I use the actual A-Frame website, but I also wanted to watch quick and simple tutorials on how to use this tool on <b>Youtube</b>. Some videos I watched involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1RdCVuu98">building enviornments</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFPMxqod2I">example code</a>. These videos were very helpful with introducing the wide variety of strategies I could use to help build the location I want for my Freedom Project. Since I am doing a project revolving around a 360° image of a galaxy setting, these videos gave me countless ideas on what objects would be best to include in my project. Along with these videos, I used and altered code under the <b>"Guides"</b> section on A-Frame (shown in "Knowledge" section of blog entry). I visited <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html">"Building a Basic Scene"</a> to understand how to make a shape such as a cube show up on my screen. I also spent a majority of my tinkering time continuing from where I left off with the guide <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/guides/building-a-360-image-gallery.html">"Building a 360° Image Gallery"</a>. These two guides and as well as the supporting Youtube videos I watched have led me in the right diection when choosing what to include in my overall location of my project, which will help me when getting into the specific placements of each and every aspect of the galaxy location I am putting my mini-game in.

### Engineering Design Process
In my <b>enginnering design process</b>, I am currently continuing to work on <b>stage 4</b>, which is to plan the most promising solution. From my previous work along this stage, as well as stages 1-3 (defining the problem, researching the problem, and brainstorming possible solutions), I have gathered a large variety of ideas for my mini-game to help give a game that is entertaining to people of all ages. One promising solution I am considering is to make the game at different levels (easy, medium, and hard) so I can give people the choice to play my game at any level of difficulty they would like to play with. This would also be helpful for the range of ages my users may be at. Another promising solution I thought of was to give different prizes to those who win my mini-game bades off of their age. To do this, I am planning to ask the user how old they are before they start playing the game to identifiy which prize they will recieve if they win beforehand by using an if, else and else, if statments. An example of this code is shown below:
```javascript
  if (age < 10) {
  prize = coloring book;
  } else {
  prize = magazine;
  }
```
