I decided to do a bit more tinkering with <b>A-Frame</b> throughout the last couple of months to be even more comfortable with all the formatting and designs this tool has to offer. Not only did I use the actual A-Frame website, but I also wanted to watch quick and simple tutorials on how to use this tool on <b>Youtube</b>. Some videos I watched involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1RdCVuu98">building enviornments</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFPMxqod2I">example code</a>. These videos were very helpful with introducing the wide variety of strategies I could use to help build the location I want for my Freedom Project. Since I am doing a project revolving around a 360° image of a galaxy setting, these videos gave me countless ideas on what objects would be best to include in my project. Along with these videos, I used and altered code under the <b>"Examples</b> section on A-Frame. I visited the guide <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html">"Building a Basic Scene"</a> to understand how to make a shape such as a cube show up on my screen. I also spent a majority of my tinkering time continuing from where I left off with the guide <a href="https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/guides/building-a-360-image-gallery.html">"Building a 360° Image Gallery"</a>. These two guides and as well as the supporting Youtube videos I watched have led me in the right diection when choosing what to include in my overall location of my project, which will help me when getting into the specific placements of each and every aspect of the galaxy location I am putting my mini-game in.
