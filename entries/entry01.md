Since I am planning on creating a mini game for my viewers, I wanted to explore some tools that would allow me to create the exact visualization I have in my head. The first tool that I have been tinkering with is “A- Frame” (https://aframe.io/). This tool is a web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences in HTML. This would be the perfect tool for me to use to be able to make a 360-degree image of the location I would want my game to be in. Along with designing a cool location, I am also planning in using a tool called “three.js.” (https://threejs.org/). This tool can create and display animated 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. This means that I could use this tool to make several different interactive characters. This will then allow my viewers to be have multiple options of people they would like to play as in my game. Lastly, I need some background noise to make the game even more thrilling! To do this, I started looking into "Earsketch" (https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/). This tool uses JS to make music. In this case, I would like to use this tool to create a mysterious sound to go with my game. This will really grab the viewers attention and allow them to really get into the mood of the game.
