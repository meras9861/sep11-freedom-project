After looking at several tools for creating my galaxy mini game, I have decided to do a lot more tinkering with [“A-Frame”](https://aframe.io/) to see how I could create the beautiful 360° image of the location I want. More specifically, I used the guide [“Building a 360° Image Gallery”](https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/guides/building-a-360-image-gallery.html) to see the exact code that would need to use to make all my different setting come to life. I learned so many different standard components such as making things in my game flat by setting src to #cubes-thumb. This in turn will allow an image to appear clear and not reflect any lights. In addition, I learned the component to change the background in my game. By using proxy-set in my code I would be able to to switch settings/backgrounds at any point in the game. Furthermore, I wanted to tinker with the [animations](https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/components/animation.html) in the background of my 360° image. By using base names such as animation, animation__2, animation__3, and so on, I would be able to have several animations wherever I would like on my image. These are only some of the many components that I have tinkered with and plan on using in my mini game to really get my viewers to be invested in it. 

So far in my engineering design process, I finished steps 1-3 by chossing a problem (there are very limited games that people of all ages can enjoy on their free time), researching it, and brainstorming possible solutions (creating a game that is fun to play for all ages and not just kids). I am started to dig a lot more deeper into step 4, planning the most promising solution. I am doing this by not only finding ways to make different images appear, but I am also making sure every animation in my game, whether it is big or small, is appropriate for every veiwer to use. Apart from this, I am continuing to think about all the interactive characters I will be putting in my mini game. I want every apsect of this game to be unique and fascinating to look at and use at the same time. This leads me into my future plans for my engineering design process, which is to get into step 5, creating a prototype as soon as possible. I would really like to lay out all of my ideas and see what concepts works and what concepts may need to be taken out. 

I have learned many things in class that will definitely play a huge role in the coding of this mini game. One thing I would like to use are boolean values/conditionals, which are values that help reveal what is true and what is false. I am thinking about using these values in my code to allow my viewers to able to answer yes/no questions throughout my mini game. This will make my game even more interactive and engaging. Another thing I learned in class that I would like to interpret into my freedom project are if / else syntaxes. This will control/take in all of the actions/responses of my viewers in the mini game so that they can move on to another level. Lastly, I would like to use are indentations. This will just keep all of my code a lot more organized and clearer to analyze. All these concepts from class will make coding this mini game so much easier for myself to do and make everything much more efficient.
