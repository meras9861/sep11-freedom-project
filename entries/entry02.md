After looking at several tools for creating my galaxy mini game, I have decided to do a lot more tinkering with [“A-Frame”](https://aframe.io/) to see how I could create the beautiful 360° image of the location I want. More specifically, I used the guide [“Building a 360° Image Gallery”](https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/guides/building-a-360-image-gallery.html) to see the exact code that would need to use to make all my different setting come to life. I learned so many different standard components such as making things in my game flat by setting src to #cubes-thumb. This in turn will allow an image to appear clear and not reflect any lights. In addition, I learned the component to change the background in my game. By using proxy-set in my code I would be able to to switch settings/backgrounds at any point in the game. Furthermore, I wanted to tinker with the [animations](https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/components/animation.html) in the background of my 360° image. By using base names such as animation, animation__2, animation__3, and so on, I would be able to have several animations wherever I would like on my image. These are only some of the many components that I have tinkered with and plan on using in my mini game to really get my viewers to be invested in it.
